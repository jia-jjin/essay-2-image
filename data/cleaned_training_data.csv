But Harry already held the written sheet in his hand.,"A young man, likely in his early twenties with a Caucasian complexion and a determined expression, stands confidently in a dimly lit, cluttered study.

His posture is upright but relaxed, with one hand gripping the sheet while the other rests casually at his side.
